    The Arborec are my favorite faction. I have a 6-1 record with them because I am a luck sack, but also by sticking to a main strategy. Despite the weak start, by the time you grow up you'll have your tendrils in everyone else's slice whether they invited you or not. The very simple '1 Production' you have on your infantry opens so many possibilities!
  </p><p>
    <strong>How to win with Arborec</strong>
  </p><p>
    Arborec must first have a strong Round 1, focus on economy, and then mobility. Your win will likely be from behind, by getting paid to take out score leaders and getting a strong late swing. I will typically only pick Arborec if I know I'm one of the two first strategy card picks (though I've won as last pick Round 1).
  </p><p>
    Unlike Saar or Sol which race to get points as fast as possible, you must be patient and leverage a swing round to catch up later. You will sow seeds early so that if someone gets ahead, you will eat them. The meta will typically work in your favour if you declare you are willing to attack the players in the lead if left alone. Buy SFFT from the other players in the back of the pack to ensure their cooperation.
  </p><p>
    <strong>Tech Paths!</strong>
  </p><p>
    I'll outline three paths, and you'll notice they don't include green tech. <em><strong>Green is a trap</strong></em>*.*  Your infantry are already plenty strong. You have more to gain by either gaining mobility or, alternatively going a PDS route, then by doubling down on your strength.
  </p><p>
    Sarween Tools is mandatory for either path. Get this first, because the economic return is greater for you than any other faction.
  </p><p>
    For mobility you typically want either Grav Drive OR Cruiser 2 depending on tech skips. If I had neither I would favor getting antimass in blue as a concession.
  </p><p>
    Plasma scoring is just good value with PDS2/DN1.  If you have a R skip you can go into Assault Cannon later on as a bonus!  If you have been building your destroyers as the game goes on and leaving them everywhere to block (as you'll see in the coming paragraphs) then late game assault cannon is amazing. There is also a world where Warsuns are just 1 tech away, but that's pretty situational.
  </p><p>
    You can go into PDS2 anytime it's relevant to board state.
  </p><p>
    <strong>Sample Tech Path 1: Blue skip</strong>
  </p><p>
    1.0 Sarween Tools
  </p><p>
    1.1 Grav Drive
  </p><p>
    1.2 Dreadnaut 2 and/or Carrier 2
  </p><p>
    1.x Plasma scoring (Good with Dreads/PDS2 and is your 2 in 2 colours)
  </p><p>
    1.x PDS2 (Situational here, but you can get it anytime you think it's relevant to board state)
  </p><p>
    <strong>Sample Tech Path 2:Green skip</strong>
  </p><p>
    2.0 Sarween Tools
  </p><p>
    2.1 Cruiser ii
  </p><p>
    2.2 PDSii
  </p><p>
    2.3 graviton (or transit diodes w/ yellow skip) OR plasma scoring
  </p><p>
    2.4 graviton (or transit diodes w/ yellow skip) OR plasma scoring
  </p><p>
    <strong>Sample Tech Path 3: No skip</strong>
  </p><p>
    3.0 Sarween Tools
  </p><p>
    3.1 PDSii
  </p><p>
    3.2 transit diodes (if yellow skip) or plasma scoring
  </p><p>
    3.3 graviton (or transit diodes w/ yellow skip) OR plasma scoring
  </p><p>
    <strong>Round 1 Strategy</strong>  Round 1 strategy is more important for Arborec than any other faction in TI4, bar none, because you are a snowball faction which <strong>needs</strong> to get off to a good start.   Their starting planet 3/4 is awful and their starting fleet is awful (1 carrier)
  </p><p>
    Picks from highest to lowest
  </p><p>
    <strong>Technology</strong>
  </p><p>
    First action, flip Tech for Sarween, so you instantly benefit from upcoming moves (never get 2 tech round 1).  Move 	carrier (build 2 inf with sarween)  Follow warfare for a carrier/2 fighters  Move carrier (build 2 inf with sarween)
  </p><p>
    <strong>Trade</strong>
  </p><p>
    Call trade before tech is popped if possible! Make as much money as possible!  Follow tech for Sarween Tools.  Follow 	warfare: carrier/fighters. Get as many infantry out as you can! Use trade to convince people to play strat cards when relevant to you!  If you have trade you're able to skip tech round 1 and it will be fine since you will be able to build 2 inf with 1 tg on your first 2 moves anyways. I would use the extra money to build a dreadnought  after you move.
  </p><p>
    Every other strategy card is mediocre in comparison to these 2.
  </p><p>
    <strong>Warfare</strong> 	(If you can take 5/6 planets)
  </p><p>
    If you have Warfare, you're not going to be able to follow Tech. <strong>You need to get at least one trade good at all costs</strong> . I'll say it again because it's that important, <strong>you need to get at least one trade good at all costs</strong>. Peddle Promissory notes as necessary. If you can sell your Trade Agreement for an extra TG after Trade is popped do it twice.  Move, build carrier (and inf with TG you gained), move 2 carriers to 2 new systems, build more infantry.  This can be a sad pick if you get locked out of trade, but with a few TG it's pretty decent.
  </p><p>
    <strong>Construction</strong> (if going PDS tech path)
  </p><p>
    Follow warfare, try not to get stalled out, get 2 forward PDS for later.  Slow start, but your slice is now defended for rest of game. Get TG (see above)
  </p><p>
    <strong>Diplomacy</strong> (if you have a 3/0 2/0 system)   Take rich system, call diplo, follow warfare, put a bunch of plastic on the board  Other people will get rich too, but your turn 1 is important enough to make that sacrifice. Still try and get TG. You probably miss tech if you go this path, but you will have an army at least.
  </p><p>
    <strong>Leadership</strong>
  </p><p>
    You'll get to follow construction/politics/warfare and set up for a better round 2, but it doesn't do much for us.
  </p><p>
    <strong>Politics</strong>   Sell speaker for TG, follow warfare
  </p><p>
    <strong>Round 2 Strategy</strong>  Take Construction/Leadership/Trade/Warfare  Accumulate more plastic, stay in your slice, set up board position by moving your fleets back and forth to maximize your production.  Sarween is a champ in this round. Build a Dreadnought  to defend your slice. Dreadnought  1 are very good for re-taking planets if people attack you, especially since there is a good chance you will get plasma scoring at some point. Get a PDS2 somewhere strategic (preferably next to mecatol)
  </p><p>
    <strong>Round 3-5 Strategy</strong>  Imperial starts to become a good pick on one of these rounds since you will need to catch up on public objectives you couldn't afford to score earlier. Start sending your carriers into undefended systems (even if you can't take the planet) and build ships (destroyers/cruisers/dn) on peoples' doorstep. The goal is just to expand borders to a point where nobody can attack you profitably, because you have put your neighbors on the defensive. Starting fights is less important than just aggressive posturing. Our goal isn't to create one massive fleet; it's to create 3-6 small fleets with PDS backup so you could be attacked anywhere and lose, but the counter attack and losses our enemies would suffer would be too great. This is known as the bramblebush (don't bother researching that, I just made it up). Retreat during the 1st round of combat if you get attacked to conserve plastic.  Our first goal is to prevent any possibility of expansion into our own slice by aggressive posturing.  Our second goal is to crush hopes and dreams.  One fun play is sending a carrier with 2 infantry and 2 fighters on it into a system with open space, then building a dreadnought and a destroyer.  A truly annoying fleet that will demand their attention, and was very little cost for us to get there.
  </p><p>
    <strong>Mecatol</strong>  If it's cheap, you should take it and root in with infantry, but you will rarely ever get the custodian token. Unless you know you will be able to call Imperial, I wouldn't waste too many resources on a system that would just put a target on our back, which is also too far from other players' home systems (the real juicy fruit).
  </p><p>
    <strong>The Infantry Trap</strong>  Our goal as Arborec is only to build the bare minimum amount of infantry so when you move forward you can leave 1/2 per planet and have 2-3 advancing with our army. Most advancing forces consist of 1 carrier/2 fighters/3inf/dread/destroyer. The Dreadnought is important because its bombardment allows us to bypass ground combat and risk losing our precious infantry! This is also why I advocate heavily for plasma scoring.
  </p><p>
    <strong>PDS Network</strong>  Look for opportunities to take construction once or twice in the game to spread out PDS over as many systems as possible. Remember, the goal is not to hold 1 system, but to make our slice taxing to take. Throw a PDS down in the middle of your opponents slice too if you get the opportunity.
  </p><p>
    <strong>Mitosis</strong>
  </p><p>
    Put an infantry on your strategy card when you pass so you'll have to physically pick it up to return your strategy card and you wont forget.
  </p><p>
    <strong>Flagship</strong>
  </p><p>
    You probably wont build this unless you have 'Unveil Flagship' since you will have to leave it in place and then activate the system to get value out of its 5 production.  We would rather have 2 Dreadnoughts for the cost.
  </p><p>
    <strong>Final thoughts</strong>  If you have executed this strategy properly, you will be in a position to King Slay the people in the lead and steal their throne.  You should have strategically picked your Support for the Throne partner, so you have an ally willing to let you get rich and give you breathing room to be the little terror you always knew you could be.
